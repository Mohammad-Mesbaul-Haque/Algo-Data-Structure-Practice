// What is Big O Notation?
// # This term uses to explain any algorithm's time or space complexity's upper bound. Big O calculate the worst case of an algorithm. 
// Contrary, Omega notation is opposite of Big O notation. Because It calculates the best case scenario. We can know from Ω notation how much performant it will be in it's best case scenario. 

// Big O Shorthand:
// 1. Arithmetic operations are constant.
// 2. Variable assignments are constant.
// 3. Accessing an array element using index number is constant.
// 4. Accessing a property of object using key is constant.
// 5. Any loop's complexity will be, inside the loop's operations complexity * how many times loop will be executed 

// If we operate a loop on a single array or collection the big O notation might be - O(n) 
// If we operate a loop on two array or collection individually , the big O notation might be - O(n +m)
// If we operate a nested loop in on a single array or collection the big O notation might be - O(n²)
// If we operate a nested loop on two array or collection individually, the big O notation might be - O(n * m)
// Sorting algorithm's big O notation might be - O(n*log(n))
// Sorted collection or array searching algorithm's big O notation might be - O(log(n))
